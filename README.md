<h1> ATM-Interface using Java Swing </h1> 

The ATM Interface project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient ATM system using Java Swing. Users can create an account by providing essential details such as name, date of birth, phone number, Aadhaar number, and a unique PIN. Each account is assigned a specific card number and PIN for login authentication. Users can perform transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, fast cash, balance inquiry, pin change, and view mini statements.
